# **Learning-Augmented K-Means Clustering Using Dimensional Reduction**

## **Overview**
This repository contains all the materials and artifacts related to the survey paper *"Learning-Augmented K-Means Clustering Using Dimensional Reduction"* by Jabari, I. K. O., et al. (2024). The paper explores the integration of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** with the **k-means algorithm** to improve clustering efficiency and accuracy for high-dimensional datasets.

## **Artifacts**
The following artifacts are included in this repository:

1. **[Medium Article](https://medium.com/@praful.john2409/enhancing-k-means-clustering-with-pca-a-comprehensive-survey-3fb999e222aa)**  
   - A detailed summary of the paper, focusing on its methodology, key findings, and results.
   
2. **[Power Point Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YQid6yf-sT2qHZG0EFGJQ5CJ1SdZ7e59gZp4iAg1JJA/edit?usp=sharing)**

3. **[Video Explanation](https://youtu.be/QOvaBDwFLNA)**  
   - A video explanation of this survey paper.

## **Key Findings**
1. PCA improves k-means clustering for high-dimensional datasets by reducing dimensionality and clustering costs.
2. Stability and efficiency of clustering increase significantly when using PCA, even for larger \(k\) values.
3. Tested datasets include:
   - Oregon Graph: Network relationships.
   - PHY Dataset: Quantum physics data.
   - CIFAR-10: Image classification dataset.
